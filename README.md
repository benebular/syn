# syn

# syn is an acronym for "syllabic nasals," a phonetic gesture in which a nasal consonant is realized as its own syllable in certain dialects of American English for words like "rotten" and "sudden."

# This is a rtMRI phonetics experiment done in conjunction with Professor Lisa Davidson at New York University to investigate the gestural qualities of syllabic nasals in American English.

# The script is intended to randomly pull and present strings of words from a list of stimuli to a participant while they are inside MRI. Additional features are described below.

# The template for this script was adpated from Julien Dirani's lexical decision task script: github.com/jdirani/psychopy_lexdec.
